        "# Question Answering System Using Dense Retrieval + BERT\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This system combines **Dense Retrieval** with **BERT** to extract answers from a knowledge base. It first converts documents into dense embeddings using **SentenceTransformers** and stores them in a **FAISS** index for fast retrieval. Then, **BERT** is used to extract the most relevant answer from the retrieved documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- **Dense Retrieval**: Uses **SentenceTransformers** for document embeddings and **FAISS** for efficient retrieval.\n",
        "- **BERT for QA**: Utilizes the pre-trained BERT model to extract answers from retrieved documents.\n",
        "- **Customizable**: Supports a variety of document sources for answering different types of queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools & Technologies\n",
        "- **SentenceTransformers**: For creating dense vector representations of documents.\n",
        "- **FAISS**: For fast similarity-based document retrieval.\n",
        "- **BERT**: For answer extraction from the retrieved documents.\n",
        "- **Python** (transformers, faiss, sentence-transformers)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow\n",
        "1. Convert documents into dense embeddings.\n",
        "2. Index the embeddings in a **FAISS** index.\n",
        "3. Use a query to retrieve the most relevant documents.\n",
        "4. Apply **BERT** to extract the answer from the top documents.\n"
